# Spice
Small shopping platform that takes customer orders and saves them into a database.

# Product Order

## Product Order Pseudo-code:

First, Iâ€™ll create a class that will capture the order-objects attributes. When shopping in a supermarket, customers pick products of certain brands and then decide on the product weight they intend to purchase. That means that an order(object) has attributes like product, weight, and cost. One unique feature about products though is that they have fixed, attributes. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Order:
1. Product
2. Weight
3. Cost

</aside>

Iâ€™ll start out by creating an order object: 

```python
def Order():
		class Order:
				def __init__(self,prod,weight): # order object gets to have this attributes.
						self.prod = prod
						self.weight = weight
						self.cost = self.weight * 10

					
			
```

Second, I have to determine how Iâ€™ll compute the order costs and totals in order to define the catalog rendering. I have a class that molds object with `prod, weight, cost` attributes. `Order` class has a `Total` method that accumulates each productâ€™s total cost. Next, I have to determine how the user will be able to make a choice and relay the user selections. `# In this section I've opted for using a sql database because it will be simpler to integrate the data and have an aggregated platform.`

Third, Iâ€™ll display the product catalog most probably in dictionary form, parse it then allow users to make selections without creating many lines of code using `if...else` conditional statements. User input variables will be used as reference objects in the dictionary iteration and conditional statements. 

```python
import pprint
import mysql.connector

def Selection():

		mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
	  host="localhost",
	  user="yourusername",
	  password="yourpassword",
	  database="mydatabase"
			)# creating a connection between the python program and the SQL database.

		mycursor = mydb.cursor()
		mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customers (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, product VARCHAR(255), weight INT, cost INT)")

		Beverage = {1:'Tea Masala',2:'Ginger',3:'Tea Leaves',4:'Sugar'} # catalog in dictionary data structure.
		pprint.pprint(Beverage)

		print('Select product to start shopping.')
		

		# I'll need to create a loop cycle that will keep on iterating as long as the conditions are met. 

		while True:
				usrInpt = int(input('Product:'))
				wghtInpt = int(input('Weight:'))
	
				for bev in Beverage.keys():
						if bev == usrInpt:
								prodNme = Beverage[usrInpt]
								order = Order(prodNme,wghtInpt)
								
								sql = "INSERT INTO customers (product, weight, cost) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
								val = (order.prod, order.weight, order.cost)
								mycursor.execute(sql, val)
								
								mydb.commit()
								
								print(mycursor.rowcount, "record inserted.")
					else:
								mycursor = mydb.cursor()

								mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")
								
								myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
								
								for x in myresult:
								  print(x)
									break

```

Finally, Iâ€™ve decided to store the records in a MySQL database because Iâ€™ve found it challenging to use a dictionary or any other data structure. I another option that I would use a text file but a database works better in this case.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Lesson:**
One thing Iâ€™ve learned is the use of the Django framework could have made it easier for me to integrate all the intended modules and tools.

</aside>

Iâ€™ll connect my MySQL database inside the transaction function and use the objectâ€™s attributes as the table fields.  Time for the next nightmare, testing it. 

Bravo!

We have a working product, itâ€™s still not serving the purpose as intended but at least Iâ€™ve found a way to channel the customer orders into a storage system, MySQL database. Iâ€™ll proceed to upload the project on GitHub and then do the updates later, it will be easier because I will have the opportunity to test the code without ruining the genesis code.
